## Tips & Best Practices

### üèÜ Pro Tips

**Always Preview First**
Use "Preview Clean" before organizing to avoid surprises. This shows you exactly what will happen without making changes.

**Start Small**
When first using TidyTop, try it with just a few test files to understand how it works.

**Regular Maintenance**
Clean your desktop weekly rather than letting files accumulate. This makes organization faster and more manageable.

**Customize First**
Set up your preferred categories and rules before your first major clean. This ensures files go where you expect them.

### üéØ Organization Strategies

**Workflow-Based Categories**
Create categories that match your work:
- "Work Projects"
- "Personal Files"
- "Client Documents"
- "Design Assets"

**Date-Based Organization**
Use day-based folders for high-volume file types like screenshots, month-based for moderate volume like PDFs.

**Smart Rules for Efficiency**
Set up rules for common file patterns:
- Company documents (prefix/suffix patterns)
- Project files (folder naming conventions)
- Downloaded files (browser naming patterns)
